Gridlock (A program to fit grids of data)
Maintainer: Jonathan Williams


DESCRIPTION

Code to fit grids of data points with various functions via chisq minimization and find fit properties (eg. vertex of fit paraboloid).  Currently implemented for data with up to 3 free parameters.  Example data is included in the 'sample_*.txt' files.

Data files must contain a line specifying the fit function, formatted 'FIT type' where 'type' is the name of the fit function (eg. 'par1', see section on available fitting functions below).  It is possible to specify grid fitting limits for each parameter in data files, see the 'sample_3par.txt' file for an example.  It is also possible to plot data (using gnuplot) by including a line in the data file specifying a plotting style, see the options section below.


FITTING FUNCTIONS AVAILABLE

Functions with 1 free parameter:
lin - f(x) = a1*x + a2
par1 - f(x) = a1*x^2 + a2*x + a3
poly3 - f(x) = a1*x^3 + a2*x^2 + a3*x + a4
Functions with 2 free parameters:
par2 - f(x,y) = a1*x^2 + a2*y^2 + a3*x*y + a4*x + a5*y + a6
Functions with 3 free parameters:
par3 - f(x,y,z) = a1*x^2 + a2*y^2 + a3*z^2 + a4*x*y + a5*x*z + a6*y*z + a7*x + a8*y + a9*z + a10


OPTIONS

Add these commands (eg. 'PLOT 1d') as a single line anywhere in the data file to enable them:
DATA_TYPE chisq - Tells the program that the data provided corresponds to reduced chi-square goodness of fit statistic values computed on a grid for each of the free parameters.
NONVERBOSE - If used, the program will only output the fit parameters (coordinates of the fit paraboloid vertex, or x and y intercept for a linear fit), which can be useful for interfacing the program with shell scripts.
PLOT 1d - Shows plot(s) in one variable, using fixed values for any other variables corresponding to the closest data points to the vertex of the fit function.
PLOT 2d - Shows plot(s) in two variables (surface plot), using fixed values for any other variables corresponding to the closest data points to the vertex of the fit function.
PLOT 3d - Shows plot in three variables (colour-coded heatmap plot) for the data, with the vertex of the fit function marked on the map.
WEIGHTED - Use weights for the data points, specified in a column after the data values.


INSTRUCTIONS

Use 'make' to compile.  Optional data plotting requires gnuplot to be installed.
To run the program from anywhere, move the resulting 'topspek' executable to any directory under your $PATH environment variable.
Tested using gcc and GNU make on Ubuntu 14.04 and Scientific Linux/CentOS 6.  Should work on more or less any Linux distro.


ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

This program uses the public domain gnuplot_i library by N. Devillard for displaying plots.
